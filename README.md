## Getting Started

First, install necessary python packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Groq API key:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Groq API Setup

1. **Get a Groq API Key**: 
   - Sign up at [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Create an API key in your dashboard

2. **Accept Terms and Conditions**:
   - Some Groq models require terms acceptance
   - If you encounter a "model_terms_required" error, visit the model playground to accept terms
   - For example: [https://console.groq.com/playground?model=mistral-saba-24b](https://console.groq.com/playground?model=mistral-saba-24b)
   - The app uses `llama3-8b-8192` by default, which doesn't require special terms acceptance

Next, start up development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Node.js Version

This project uses [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions. The required version is specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

**Before running or developing locally:**

```
nvm install # installs the version in .nvmrc
nvm use     # switches to the correct version
```

If you use Husky or pre-commit hooks, make sure your shell session is using the correct Node version (`nvm use`).

For CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions), ensure the workflow uses the Node version in `.nvmrc`.
