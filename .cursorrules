## 👤 User Context

### User Profile
- Product designer with limited coding experience
- Prefers detailed explanations over brief technical answers
- Learning-focused approach to development

### Communication Preferences
- Use smaller, incremental changes
- Provide educational context and explanations
- Break down complex concepts into simple steps
- Explain reasoning behind decisions
- Use clear visual signals: ⚠️ 🛑 ⏸️ 📋 ✅

### Code Changes
- Make incremental changes, not large modifications
- Add detailed comments explaining what and why
- For large/risky changes:
  - Use "⚠️ LARGE CHANGE ALERT" or "🛑 HIGH RISK MODIFICATION"
  - Provide specific warnings
  - Wait for user confirmation before implementing
- Always explain each step of code changes

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Python (recipe-scrapers)
- **AI**: Groq API (Llama models), OpenAI SDK
- **Storage**: localStorage (client-side)

### Key Patterns
- Context API for state management (RecipeContext, ParsedRecipesContext)
- API routes in `/app/api/` for backend logic
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` for reusable logic
- UI components in `/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui)
- Utility functions in `/utils/` and `/lib/`

## 🎯 Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript
- Always use explicit types
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Define interfaces for complex objects

### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use loading states for async operations
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Comments
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- Document function purposes and parameters
- Include TODO comments for future improvements

### Error Handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
